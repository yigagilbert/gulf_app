Client profile is correctly updated with new photo URL. Old photos are properly deleted when new ones are uploaded. All edge cases tested successfully: invalid client ID returns 404, non-admin users get 403 Forbidden, invalid file types return 400 Bad Request. Fixed error handling issue where HTTPExceptions were being caught and converted to 500 errors.

Root cause: Static files were mounted at '/uploads' but API routes use '/api' prefix, causing URL mismatch. Photos were being uploaded with URLs like '/uploads/profile_photos/...' but these were being served by frontend (returning HTML) instead of backend (returning actual images). SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: 1) Updated static file mounting from '/uploads' to '/api/uploads' in main.py, 2) Updated photo URLs in admin.py to return '/api/uploads/profile_photos/...' format, 3) Updated document URLs for consistency. VERIFICATION: All tests now pass - photos upload correctly, URLs are properly formatted, static file serving works with correct content-type (image/png instead of text/html), and photos are accessible via the returned URLs. The issue was backend configuration, not frontend code."

The client deletion functionality correctly supports secure admin-only deletion with comprehensive cascading cleanup of all associated data including documents, chat messages, job applications, and physical files. The system properly enforces authentication and authorization, handles error cases correctly, and provides detailed audit information for all deletion operations.

**Admin Client Profile Photo Upload System Verification:** The new POST /api/admin/clients/{client_id}/photo endpoint has been thoroughly tested and verified working correctly. Successfully tested photo upload functionality with proper admin authentication, file validation (JPEG/PNG only), response structure with profile_photo_url field, client profile updates, old photo deletion, and comprehensive error handling for all edge cases. Fixed error handling issue to ensure proper HTTP status codes (404 for invalid client ID, 403 for non-admin users, 400 for invalid file types). The endpoint is production-ready for the AdminClientDetailsPage redesign.

**Client Deletion System Verification:** The DELETE /api/admin/clients/{client_id} endpoint has been thoroughly tested and verified working correctly. Successfully tested deletion of client 'YIGA GILBERT' (a434d812-1c6a-4e3d-945a-8153c7088c51) with 45 associated documents. All cascading deletions work properly, client is removed from client list, proper authentication/authorization enforced, error handling working for edge cases, and response format includes complete audit information. The client deletion system is production-ready and secure.

**Admin Document Upload Issue Resolution:** The 403 Forbidden issue mentioned in the review request could not be reproduced during extensive testing. All admin document upload requests are successful. The issue appears to be either already resolved, environment-specific, or related to frontend token handling rather than backend permissions. The backend API is functioning correctly for admin document uploads.

**Status Management System Resolution:** Fixed a critical schema mismatch between models.py and schemas.py that was causing 500 Internal Server Error when using the 'returned' status. The ClientStatusEnum in schemas.py now correctly matches the ClientStatus enum in models.py, supporting all four required status values. The complete status workflow is now fully functional.
