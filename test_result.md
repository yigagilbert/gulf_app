**Admin Client Profile Photo Upload System Verification:** The new POST /api/admin/clients/{client_id}/photo endpoint has been thoroughly tested and verified working correctly. Successfully tested photo upload functionality with proper admin authentication, file validation (JPEG/PNG only), response structure with profile_photo_url field, client profile updates, old photo deletion, and comprehensive error handling for all edge cases. Fixed error handling issue to ensure proper HTTP status codes (404 for invalid client ID, 403 for non-admin users, 400 for invalid file types). The endpoint is production-ready for the AdminClientDetailsPage redesign.

**Admin Document Upload Issue Resolution:** The 403 Forbidden issue mentioned in the review request could not be reproduced during extensive testing. All admin document upload requests are successful. The issue appears to be either already resolved, environment-specific, or related to frontend token handling rather than backend permissions. The backend API is functioning correctly for admin document uploads.

**Status Management System Resolution:** Fixed a critical schema mismatch between models.py and schemas.py that was causing 500 Internal Server Error when using the 'returned' status.
