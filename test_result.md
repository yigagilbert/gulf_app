        comment: "CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED: Photo upload was working but photos were not displaying in frontend due to static file serving configuration issue. Root cause: Static files were mounted at '/uploads' but API routes use '/api' prefix, causing URL mismatch. Photos were being uploaded with URLs like '/uploads/profile_photos/...' but these were being served by frontend (returning HTML) instead of backend (returning actual images). SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: 1) Updated static file mounting from '/uploads' to '/api/uploads' in main.py, 2) Updated photo URLs in admin.py to return '/api/uploads/profile_photos/...' format, 3) Updated document URLs for consistency. VERIFICATION: All tests now pass - photos upload correctly, URLs are properly formatted, static file serving works with correct content-type (image/png instead of text/html), and photos are accessible via the returned URLs. The issue was backend configuration, not frontend code."

The client deletion functionality correctly supports secure admin-only deletion with comprehensive cascading cleanup of all associated data including documents, chat messages, job applications, and physical files. The system properly enforces authentication and authorization, handles error cases correctly, and provides detailed audit information for all deletion operations.

**Admin Client Profile Photo Upload System Verification:** The new POST /api/admin/clients/{client_id}/photo endpoint has been thoroughly tested and verified working correctly. Successfully tested photo upload functionality with proper admin authentication, file validation (JPEG/PNG only), response structure with profile_photo_url field, client profile updates, old photo deletion, and comprehensive error handling for all edge cases.

The backend API is functioning correctly for admin document uploads.

**Status Management System Resolution:** Fixed a critical schema mismatch between models.py and schemas.py that was causing 500 Internal Server Error when using the 'returned' status. The ClientStatusEnum in schemas.py now correctly matches the ClientStatus enum in models.py, supporting all four required status values. The complete status workflow is now fully functional.
