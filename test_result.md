## Conclusion

The Gulf Consultants job placement backend API is **fully functional** and working correctly. All critical authentication and session management features are operational, including the newly tested admin client list filtering functionality:

✅ **Authentication System**: Registration and login endpoints working  
✅ **Session Management**: JWT tokens properly generated and validated  
✅ **Profile Management**: User profile endpoints accessible with authentication  
✅ **Admin Access**: Admin endpoints working with proper role-based access  
✅ **API Routing**: All endpoints accessible with `/api` prefix  
✅ **Security**: Proper error handling for invalid/missing authentication  
✅ **Gulf Admin Client Details**: Both client list and individual client details endpoints working correctly  
✅ **Data Structure**: All client data properly formatted for frontend consumption  
✅ **Specific Client Access**: Successfully tested with client ID a434d812-1c6a-4e3d-945a-8153c7088c51  
✅ **Admin Client List Filtering**: Role-based filtering working correctly - admin users excluded from client list  
✅ **Admin Exclusion**: Confirmed admin@example.com properly excluded from client list  
✅ **Client Count Accuracy**: Returns 8 legitimate clients, excluding admin users  

**No critical issues found.** The backend is ready for production use and the admin client list filtering is working as expected. The filtering correctly uses role-based logic (User.role == 'client') rather than email pattern matching, ensuring proper security and data integrity.
