The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the Gulf Consultants job onboarding application from an MVP to a robust platform. Key initial efforts included resolving a critical session persistence bug, which involved fixing backend routing (adding  prefixes), correcting CORS, removing conflicting frontend environment variables (), and refining  dependencies to prevent re-renders. Following this, the engineer implemented comprehensive admin features: a full client document management system (upload, view, verify, delete), an advanced client status tracking system (new, verified, traveled, returned) with administrative control, and secure client deletion with cascading data removal and confirmation dialogs. Significant focus was also placed on improving the platform's responsiveness, particularly for the admin status update modal and the entire admin client management section, ensuring full functionality on mobile devices. The latest task involves redesigning the admin client details page to include a centered profile photo with an upload option and a letter placeholder, a task currently in progress with a recent code edit.

<product_requirements>
The Gulf Consultants application aims to facilitate job onboarding, client data management, and communication between admins and clients with a mobile-first approach. Core functionalities include user authentication, client profiles, document management, and job tracking. Key features implemented include an enhanced admin-client chat, multi-step client onboarding, and full application branding. Admins can create and manage client accounts, including viewing client profiles, uploading documents (CVs, passports, etc.) for clients, and utilizing an in-app PDF viewer. Admin capabilities further extended to managing client statuses (new, verified, traveled, returned) and securely deleting client profiles. The application requires a fully responsive design for both admin and client interfaces, ensuring all functionalities are accessible and user-friendly across various screen sizes. Ongoing work includes refining UI/UX, such as redesigning the admin client details page for profile picture display and upload functionality.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Complete Admin Client Details Page Redesign**: Finish implementing the new layout for the  to include a centered profile photo, a letter placeholder, and the functionality for admins to upload profile photos.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on redesigning the  to enhance its visual layout and functionality. The user explicitly requested a profile photo at the top center of the page, with a letter placeholder if no photo is uploaded, and the ability for admins to upload this profile photo. The  method has been added/updated in  to support this. The  component has undergone a complete redesign, and a recent code edit was made to fix a syntax error () that occurred during this redesign, caused by leftover code after the export statement. The current state is that the code for the redesigned page has been edited, and the syntax error fixed, but the changes have not yet been tested to verify the new layout and functionality.
